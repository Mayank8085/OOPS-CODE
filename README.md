## Problem Statements

1. Introduction :- Create a class named weather report that holds a daily weather report with data members day_of_month,
hightemp, lowtemp,a mount_rain and amount_snow. Use different types of constructors to initialize the
objects. Also include a function that prompts the user and sets values for each field so that you can
override the default values. Write a menu driven program in C++ with options to enter data and generate
monthly report that displays average of each attribute.

2. Operator Overloading :- 
    
        a. Design a class ‘Complex ‘with data members for real and imaginary part. Provide default and parameterized constructors. Write a program to perform arithmetic operations of two complex numbers using operator overloading. Addition and subtraction using friend functions

        b. Design a class ‘Complex ‘with data members for real and imaginary part. Provide default and parameterized constructors. Write a program to perform arithmetic operations of two complex numbers using operator overloading. Multiplication and division using member functions

3. Multiple Inheritance :- Design a base class with name, date of birth, blood group and another base class consisting of the data members such as height and weight. Design one more base class consisting of the insurance policy number and contact address. The derived class contains the data members’ telephone numbers and driving license number. 
    
        Write a menu driven program to carry out the following operations: 
        i. Build a master table   ii. Display   iii. Insert a new entry
        iv. Delete entry          v. Edit       vi.  Search for a recor

4. Virtual Function :- Create a base class shape with two double type values and member functions to input the data andcompute_area() for calculating area of figure. Derive two classes’ triangle and rectangle. Make compute_area() as a virtual function and redefine this function in the derived class to suit their requirements. Write a program that accepts dimensions of triangle/rectangle and display calculated area

5. ErrorHanding :-Write a program in C++ which includes the code for following operations :

        i. A function to read twodouble type numbers from keyboard
        ii. A function to calculate the division of these two numbers
        iii. A try block to detect and throw an exception if the condition “divide-by-zero” occurs
        iv. Appropriate catch block to handle the exceptions thrown

6. Template :- Write a program in C++ using function/class template to read two matrices of different data types such as integers and floating point values and perform simple arithmetic operations on these matrices separately and display it

7. File Operations:- Write a program in C++ to implement sequential file for students' database and perform following operations on it

         i. Create Database   ii. Display Database   iii. Add a record
         iv. Delete a record   v. Modify a record
